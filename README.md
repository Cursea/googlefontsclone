# Chingu Voyage 13 Pre-Work Project: Favourite Fonts (Tier 2). A Google Fonts Clone.

This is a pre-work project written for [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) Voyage 13. Chingu is a platform which bring people from all over the world to work on real project in real teams. The pre-work, in particular, is a individual project to validate one's skills.

**My finish project can be found [here.](https://shammy8.github.io/googlefontsclone/)**

## Features

This is a clone of [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) written in React with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). A list of the main requirements (as specified by Chingu) can be found [here](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/voyage-prework-tier2-favfonts), all of which (including the requirement in the Extra section of the link) were completed.

A few additional features were added to more closely mimic the real Google Fonts. These include:

- [x] a randomised inspirational quote used as the sample text in each font card
- [x] a side drawer menu for narrower screens
- [x] more font cards renders when scrolled to the bottom of the page
- [x] a search bar which sticks to the top of the browser when user scrolls down
- [x] a bottom drawer menu for user selected fonts
- [x] generating the &lt;link&gt; tag to be placed in the &lt;head&gt; of the HTML document.
